/*
Yes, that is correct. If you have a char *p that is pointing 
to a string, then p[1] is the value of the second character
 of the string that p is pointing to. And &p[1] is the address 
 of that second character, not the address of the pointer p itself.
Specifically:
p is a pointer to a character, which means it holds the address of 
the first character in a string. p[1] accesses the second character 
in the string that p is pointing to, because array indexing starts at 0.
&p[1] gives you the address of that second character, not the address of 
the pointer p.*/
